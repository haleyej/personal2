                <p><em>Mostly an archive for me, but hopefully it provides inspiration to others!</em></p>
                <h3>Books</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bodies on the Line by Lauren Rankin</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Really good history of clinic escorts and clinic defenders! Rankin does
                                a great job historically situating the pro-choice movement. 
                                Written pre Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, so some of the chapters, 
                                particularly the last one, felt like watching a slow moving car crash.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>Eileen by Ottessa Moshfegh</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The first 200 pages and like whatever but then the last 50 are INSANE. 
                                If you enjoy a slow-build or stories with unexpected twists, then I highly 
                                recommend.
                            </li>

                    <li><b>Thanks for Everything (Now Get Out) by Joseph Margulies</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This was kind of meh. The author profiles the Olneyville neighborhood of 
                                Providence, RI but in my opinion it spends too much time on the case study and not 
                                enough on the general point about gentrification and displacement that the author 
                                is trying to make.

                    <li><b>The White Album by Joan Didion</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What can I say about Joan Didion that hasn't already been said? I coincidentally read this 
                                right before moving out to California, which felt very on-the-nose.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>Trick Mirror by Jia Tolentino</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                An instant classic, one of my favorites of all time.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>Normal People by Sally Rooney</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The hype is real and the Hulu series is just as good.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed For Men by Caroline Criado Perez</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This book was so underwhelming and just threw out random statistics about 
                                data bias against women without really <em>saying anything.</em> I'm always
                                floored when people recommend this.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>Norweigan Wood by Haruki Murakami</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The writing is so beautiful that I honestly forget that it's lowkey a little sexist while reading it.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>Bad Blood by John Carreyrou</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                No matter how crazy tyou think the Theranos saga was, I promise it's crazier. Great 
                                investigative reporting and a suprisingly quick read.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>The Cult of We: WeWork, Adam Neumann, and the Great Startup Delusion By Eliot Brown & Maureen Farrell</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Another fantastic journalistic take-down of a start up. I honestly think this is better than Bad Blood 
                                but this book is like 400 pages long. The authors do a great job connecting WeWork's downfall to 
                                broader issues in the start-up world and venture capital.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>Cultish: The Language of Fanatacism by Amanda Montell</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This book isn't as "deep" as my usual non-fiction reads, but it goes quickly and it's very interesting.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>Profiles in Ignorance: How America's Politicians Got Dumb and Dumber by Andy Borowitz</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            I picked up this book after I heard the author speak on the New Yorker radio hour about the rise of 
                            anti-intellectualism in American politics. I was interested in reading more about why politicians (who's 
                            lives and careers have been defined almost entirely by their membership in elite institutions) need to 
                            pretend they're a "common man" and "close to the people" to get elected. This book didn't discuss any of that!
                            It was 200 pages of 'wow these Republicans are so stupid!' I do not recommend this book, a waste of money and time.
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        I picked this up in a used bookstore on Valencia Street in San Francisco's Mission District. Joan Didion 
                        is incredble as always. 
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How our Government Segregated America by Richard Rothstein</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        This was one of the best books I read in 2022. This excellent book breaks down the myth that segregation in 
                        America is primarily the product of individual preference — de facto segregation — and explains the many ways
                        the government used the law and state power to reinforce segregation and create de jure segregation in areas
                        where it didn't already exists. Covers a wide range of topics, including racially restrictive housing covenants, 
                        white flight, redlining, and federal agencies refusing to give/insure morgages for Black families.
