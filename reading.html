                                a great job historically situating the pro-choice movement. 
                                Written pre Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, so some of the chapters, 
                                particularly the last one, felt like watching a slow moving car crash 
                            </li>

                                The first 200 pages and like whatever but then the last 50 are INSANE. 
                                If you enjoy a slow-build or stories with unexpected twists, then I highly 
                                recommend

                                This was kind of meh. The author profiles the Olneyville neighborhood of 
                                Providence, RI but in my opinion it spends too much time on the case study and not 
                                enough on the general point about gentrification and displacement that the author 
                                is trying to make

                        <ul>
                            <li>What can I say about Joan Didion that hasn't already been said? I coincidentally read this 
                                right before moving out to California, which felt very on-the-nose

                                An instant classic, one of my favorites of all time

                            <li>The hype is real and the hulu series is just as good</li>

                    <li><b>Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed For Men by Caroline Criado Perez</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This book was so underwhelming and just threw out random statistics about 
                                data bias against women without really <em>saying anything.</em> I'm always
                                floored when people recommend this
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>Norweigan Wood by Haruki Murakami</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The writing is so beautiful that I honestly forget that it's lowkey a little sexist while reading it
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>Bad Blood by John Carreyrou</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                No matter how crazy tyou think the Theranos saga was, I promise it's crazier. Great 
                                investigative reporting and a suprisingly quick read
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>The Cult of We: WeWork, Adam Neumann, and the Great Startup Delusion By Eliot Brown & Maureen Farrell</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Another fantastic journalistic take-down of a start up. I honestly think this is better than Bad Blood 
                                but this book is like 400 pages long. The authors do a great job connecting WeWork's downfall to 
                                broader issues in the start-up world and venture capital
                            </li>

                    <li><b>Cultish: The Language of Fanatacism by Amanda Montell</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This book isn't as "deep" as my usual non-fiction reads, but it goes quickly and it's very interesting
                            </li>
